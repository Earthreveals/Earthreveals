## Hi there 👋
👋 I'm immersed in the vibrant field of Data Science, honing my skills at UC Berkeley's esteemed Data Analytics Bootcamp. As a Senior Training and Development Specialist at J.P. Morgan Chase, I blend the art of teaching with the science of finance, creating classroom and e-learning experiences that enrich and empower our team members.

🎓 My academic path includes a robust foundation in Chemistry from Sacramento State University, complemented by an MBA from Golden Gate University where I merged the worlds of finance and marketing. My quest for knowledge is perpetual, as evidenced by my ongoing Master's in Information Design and Strategy at Northwestern University, where I am sculpting my future in the AI landscape.

🔍 I specialize in the intricacies of data visualization and analytics, with a keen interest in developing cutting-edge curriculums that bridge the gap between complex data concepts and practical implementation.

📈 In this repository, you'll find projects that reflect my passion for merging analytics with actionable learning developments. Each commit represents a step towards my ultimate goal of becoming a transformative force in the Learning and Development sphere, specifically through the lens of data-driven decision-making.

🌿 When not delving into datasets or architecting learning modules, I indulge in wildlife photography and contribute to magazines as a freelance writer, capturing the unpredictable beauty of nature through my lens.

Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this exhilarating journey at the intersection of data, design, and development.
